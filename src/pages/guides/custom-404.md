A 404 page is the page your users see when they try to visit a link on your website that doesn't exist.

On Neocities, you can customize what yours looks like.

To edit this file, look for a file in your Home directory called `not_found.html`.

If you have previously deleted this file, you can create a new one with the same file name and it will "magically" work.

Without customization, the page looks like this:

You can make any changes you'd like to this page, as if it were any other webpage.
