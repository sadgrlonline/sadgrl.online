The recent update I did led some people to believe I'm leaving for good. In
    fact, I was preparing to return! But I understand why it seemed otherwise.
    Words like "death" and "endings" convey a note of finality.
</p> <p>
I've always felt a strong connection to the metaphorical concept of death as
    a necessary step before rebirth. In that sense, I have "died" more than
    once. Some deaths are more painful than others. But transformation is one of
    the most beautiful and exhilarating parts of being alive.
</p> <p>
One thing you'll learn if you stick around here long enough, is that I tend
    towards intensity. I think in some ways it was easier to be myself as a
    teenager. That's because it's much more socially acceptable for a teenager
    to be dramatic and intense and emotional. I don't think I have it in me to
    be laid-back or casual, except as a poorly-fitting and hollow disguise.
</p> <p>
I came back here to transform my website and to embrace this intensity. I
    wrote a little about this <a href="/posts/its-personal" style="color:var(--accent-purple)">on my blog</a>. My goal is to continue to write, to evolve, and to connect with others
    over the shared pain of the human experience (as a treat).
